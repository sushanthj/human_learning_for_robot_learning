    Defines an MLP for supervised learning which maps observations to actions

    * Here we have an MLP to predict the mean of a Gaussian Distribution.
    * We also have a separate parameter to learn the log standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution.

    Attributes
    ----------
    logits_na: nn.Sequential
        A neural network that outputs dicrete actions
    mean_net: nn.Sequential
        A neural network that outputs the mean for continuous actions
    logstd: nn.Parameter
        A separate parameter to learn the standard deviation of actions

    Methods
    -------
    get_action:
        Calls the actor forward function
    forward:
        Runs a differentiable forwards pass through the network
    update:
        Trains the policy with a supervised learning objective
